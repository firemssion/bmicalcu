# Simple BMI Calculator

This repository contains a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorise a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. 

The categories of the BMI are taken from the Singapore Heart Foundation, which provides a useful reference for the population of Singapore.
